# this is the base file for the documentation of Radii

This documentation is generated with restructured text files (.rst). They are a simple text format that makes it possible to edit them easily and transparent.
File formats such as pdf. or Websites(html) are generated from the .rst files. The library that that is used for the generation is called sphinx. After its installation
the easiest way to generate an updated html or pdf, is by navigating with the command prompt to the docs folder and typing: "make html" or "make pdf" the later
need more dependencies but the following error messages will tell you about them.

The two files that control the template as well as the general settings are the central index.rst that give the structure and fuctions as the home page.
The conf.py has all the webpage options, the theme and generally controlls the look of the website.
It also holds all links that are used throughout the pages as links.
