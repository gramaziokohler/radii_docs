Tutorial: Advanced Presentation
**********************************

.. topic:: What this is about

  This tutorial will show how to create a more advanced presentation with the `Publish Animation`_ and `Publish Control`_ .

With `Publish Animation`_ it is possible to send viewers on defined paths and `Publish Control`_ lets you control the display settings of all viewers as well as the weather and the background. With `Publish Reference`_ it is possible to direct the viewers to load references into the scene from the cloud.  

With the scenario manager of the `Save Scenario`_ component, you can bundle the content of all or some of the publish components and save them into a series of scenarios to switch through them.

Component list 
-------------------------

to be linked to the `Connect`_ component:

- PublishMaterial_
- PublishGeometry_
- `Publish Section`_ 
- `Publish View`_
- `Publish Animation`_
- `Publish Reference`_
- `Publish Control`_
- `Save Scenario`_
- `Save Content`_


Examples
------------------------

The plan is to do the following: Geometry (a building) that has to be publish or downloaded from the server (1), then a walk through it, change the time of the day and the weather (2) and continue your tour via a series of pre defined views (3-4).

Setting and sending the above mentioned live during a presentation takes a lot of time. It is quicker to collect the content into scenarios and save them. Switch through them during a presentation then becomes more easier and makes more complex presentations possible.
