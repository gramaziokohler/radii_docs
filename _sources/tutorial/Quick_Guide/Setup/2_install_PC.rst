Technical Information
**************************************************************************

While the Radii Viewer can run on simple machines, the resources necessary scale with the complexity of the model.
As a live renderer the Radii Viewer needs more computing power than CAD Software (Rhino). A model that is almost to complex in CAD, will not run on a device in the Viewer.
For very big models it can be necessary to run the Rhino Editor on a different device than the viewer.

For 32bit system there is a limit of 2GB for each component and saves.

.. topic:: Radii PC requirements:
  
  - ideally min. 4 GB of RAM but also works with 2 GB for small projects
  - a graphics card of medium strength or higher
  - Rhino 3D license to use Grasshopper (only necessary for the Plugin)
