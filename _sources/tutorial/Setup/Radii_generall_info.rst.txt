******************************************


RADii is a Cloud platform where you can publish (upload) your 3D Models share them or collaborate on them. It also offers a very direct interface to get a life connection between the model you are working on and a VR/AR Environment.
RADii consists of a Rhino Grasshopper plugin to publish 3D Models and viewers for different devices (for PC/Mac, VR Glasses or mobile devices) to receive them.
RADii is being developed by Thomas Lee since 2020. Since 2022 he colaborates with Gramazio Kohler Research to further develop the tool within the environment of the Immersive Studio.
