_______________
Viewer PC/Mac
_______________

To explore models in Radii you need a viewer, this is a program that enables you to join a server (we call them channels) and download the models.
Viewers are available for a number of different operating systems such as Windows/Mac, IPhone/Android and Oculus. 
The viewers are generally the same but have some differences, usually due to computing power.

1. **Download** the latest Radii Viewer from https://radii.info/
2. **Register** in the user panel **and confirm** your email 
    - it is not necessary to set a domain name
3. **Install** the file
4. **Start** RADii Viewer

**Congratulations** you have installed Radii. On how to use Radii consult the Quick Guide and the Viewer documentation

__________________
Grashopper Plugin
__________________

The plugin enables you to publish (send) 3D models and other geometry. 
Publishing works similar to a Radio station, geometry can be received by others as long as they are connected 
to the same channel as the sender. 

1. **Download** the latest Radii Plugin from https://radii.info/
2. If you did not already: **Register** in the user panel **and confirm** your email 
    - it is not necessary to set a domain name
3. **Unpack** the .Zip file 
4. **Drag & drop** the Radii.gha file it into the Rhino Grashopper window, you open it by typing the "grashopper" command in rhino
5. **Check** if the install was successful, it should be visible in one your tabs as shown below.

**Congratulations !** you have installed Grashopper Radii. On how to publish consult the Quick Guide and the Radii Grashopper documentation

________
Oculus
________

Please be aware that the Oculus and its environments are subject to frequent changes, the following tutorial might be out of date or diverge slightly from the current state. We are hoping to release a viewer through the app store at a later stage.

1. Download the advanced version of sidequest from https://sidequestvr.com/ and install it
2. Download the .apk file from Radii.info in the Download section
3. Set your Oculus account to developer mode (you have to be part of a developer organization), log in to your account on your device and enable Settings > System > Developer, and then turn on the USB Connection Dialog option.
4. Connect the Oculus to your device and start side on the later
5. Allow for debugging on your Oculus
6. On sidequest select the install .apk file and install

To find the Radii Viewer app on Oculus:

1. Select the app library
2. Filter apps for unknown sources 
3. Start Radii Viewer VR

Congratulations you have installed Radii on your Vr device

Technical Prerequisites
____________________________

To use Radii a Pc with an internet connection and Windows or Mac operating system is needed.
The computing and ram capacity can vary greatly depending on the size and detail of the 3D model.
The Rhino Grashopper plugin is generally very efficient and can run on older machines. 
The Radii Viewer for PC as a live renderer need more computing power. It can be necessary to run Rhino on one machine and the viewer on another for
a seamless use.

We advice for an absolute minimum of 4GB of RAM, better would be 8GB that is current standard, or more.
The deciding technical factor for the viewer is the strength of the used graphic car

During our tests, on a range of devices, we have observed that:

- simple and small models can be viewed and streamed in parallel on a medium strong laptop 
- for bigger models we advice for a strong graphic card and at least 16 GB of RAM for the viewer and potentially the use of a second device for publishing with Rhino Grashopper

Server Storage:

By creating an account you get a limited amount of server space that you can use. If your models 
are bigger you need to apply for more. 
As member of an affiliated organization your will automatically recognized if you register with your organizations email address.

Preparation, time and infrastructure
_________________________________________________

**Lv 1. A walkthrough with a group:**

*Preparation and time:* 1 Day for the publisher, 20 min. for the group 

The publisher: understand the basic of how to stream geometry with Radii Grashopper and the basics on operating the viewer.
The observers: Install the viewer, log into the server and navigate

*Tech:*

The Designer: min. a laptop of medium strength for streaming and running the viewer in parallel
The observers:  min. a laptop of medium strength for running the viewer


**Lv 2. Class of students work and develop their projects through a semester with Radii:**

*Preparation and time:* 3-4 days of preparation to understand the program and be able to teach it.

We teach Radii in 3 seatings throughout the semester in a total of 5 hours, with constant usage in between.
This enables the student to test models in Radii as well as present them at the end.

The first 1,5 hours explain the basics on how to use the viewer and the grashopper plugin
For the viewer this includes how to connect to a channel and navigate in a model. In grashopper
is is about the most basic workflow and most important publishing components.
In the second sitting we introduce the saving to the cloud and locally in radii files, how to animate, define views and basics of publish control. 
The third class goes into detail about the scenario manager that is part of publish control and leaves time for possible subscribe components.

*Tech:*

- Personal laptops of medium strength for each student
- Min. one strong PC for presentations for the viewer to run on

  - ideally one per group to allow for stronger access and testing

- A bigger screen/projector relative to the size of the class
- Optional:
  
  - Oculus or other Vr devices (at the time of writing only Oculus is supported)
  - Phones or Ipads for augmented reality usage
  - Open space to walk around in VR/Ar


**Lv 3. Interactive collaborative work**


**TO BE ADDED**
