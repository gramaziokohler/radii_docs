------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Preparation and time:* 3-4 days of preparation to understand the program and be able to teach it.

We teach Radii in 3 seatings throughout the semester in a total of 5 hours, with constant usage in between.
This enables the student to test models in Radii as well as present them at the end.

The first 1,5 hours explain the basics on how to use the viewer and the grasshopper plugin
For the viewer this includes how to connect to a channel and navigate in a model. In grasshopper
is is about the most basic workflow and most important publishing components.
In the second sitting we introduce the saving to the cloud and locally in RADii files, how to animate, define views and basics of publish control. 
The third class goes into detail about the scenario manager that is part of publish control and leaves time for possible subscribe components.
