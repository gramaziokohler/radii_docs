***************************************************
Ten rules for working with Radii
***************************************************

Following these rules should prevent you from running into errors and performance issues. 
This becomes more important in the later phases of a project.

  ======  =====================================================================================   ==================================================================================================
  **1**   You shall **use mesh count wisely**                                                     Do not use thousands of vertices on a small door handle see: PublishGeometry_
  **2**   You shall **not use hidden or duplicate objects** and materials                         Purge objects that are never going to be seen by anybody or used by anything
  **3**   You shall **apply relative level of detail** to object size, importance and distance    Do not spend time and performance doing high level of detail on objects you will never get close to
  **4**   You shall **keep the texture resolutions low** and relative to the object sizes         Do not use large texture resolution on small objects. See options of PublishMaterial_
  **5**   You shall **trim and subsample point clouds** relative to distance and visibility       Do not use millions on points on something that is seen from far away or obscured by other objects
  **6**   You shall only **apply collision to objects that  is required** to collide with         Do not put collision on screws, nails, fixtures etc. see: PublishGeometry_
  **7**   You shall make **content specific to viewer devices**                                   Do not expect to run a scene with a high number of objects on and underpowered platform like a mobile phone or Oculus Standalone
  **8**   You shall **watch** the scene **for places of performance degradation**                 Always test the scene for places where the performance drops (no lower than 25-30 fps) and react accordingly with any of the above
  **9**   You shall **only publish when needed**                                                  Do not spam content. Publish large static content like context, once while working on it then only keep the part of the scene live that your working on
  **10**  You shall **report bugs**                                                               Always report a bug to `Github <https://github.com/Archtica/RADii/issues>`_

  ======  ========================================================================  ==================================================================================================
  **1**   **Only publish if necessary**                                             Do not spam content. Publish large static content like context, once while working on it then only keep the part of the scene live that your working on
  **2**   **Prepare your content according to the power of the viewer's device**    Complex scenes can make the viewers on slower devices choke
  **3**   **Keep an eye on frame rate performance drops in your scene**             Check your scene for places with performance drops (no lower than 25-30 fps) and solve issues below
  **4**   **Apply relative level of detail**                                        Use your effort highly detailed modelling thoughtfully and only where necessary
  **5**   **Use mesh count wisely**                                                 Keep an eye on the meshing of your geometries. See also: PublishGeometry_
  **6**   **Check your scene for hidden or duplicate objects and materials**        Purge geometries that are occluded from view as well as unused materials
  **7**   **Use adequate texture resolutions**                                      Match the texture resolution to the object size. See options of PublishMaterial_
  **8**   **Only apply collision to objects if needed**                             Do not put collision on screws, nails, fixtures etc. see: PublishGeometry_
  **9**   **Trim and subsample point clouds**                                       Pointclouds can very quickly generate heavy scenes. Process them to fit your viewer's device: @help add link to pointcloud editing here
  **10**  **Report bugs**                                                           If you find things working unexpectedly, please report to `Github <https://github.com/Archtica/RADii/issues>`_
