`RADii <https://RADii.info/>`_ is a cloud platform where you can publish (upload) 3D Models to share, explore and collaborate. 

RADii consists of two parts, a plugin for the CAD software Rhino Grasshopper to publish (upload) 3D Models and programs called Viewers that run on a range of devices ( PC/Mac, VR Headsets or mobile devices) to receive and explore the models.

How RADii works
___________________


.. image:: tutorial/Radii_diagramms/Daten_Diagramme_v2/svg/Radii_funktionality_simple_crop.svg

**How it works simplified:** A CAD software (Rhino Grasshopper) is connected to a cloud through a plugin. 3D Models are live uploaded to the cloud (Unity) and then distributes them to the RADii viewers.
The RADii Viewers are a program that can be run on PC/Mac, iPhone and VR Headsets. Viewers are connected through the cloud and can interact with each other.

About
___________________

RADii is being developed by Thomas W. Lee since 2020. In 2022 he started a collaboration with Gramazio Kohler Research at ETHZ for further development of the program in the context of the Immersive Design Studio. 
ETH supported this project with a `Innovedum Grant <https://ethz.ch/de/die-eth-zuerich/lehre/innovedum/innovedum-fund.html>`_ , which among other this made this documentation possible.
