How Radii works:

**How it works simplified:** A CAD software (Rhino Grasshopper) is connected to a cloud through a plugin. 3D Models are live uploaded the cloud (Unity) and then distributes them to the Radii viewers.
The Radii Viewers are a program that can be run on PC/Mac, Iphone and Vr Glasses. Viewers are connected through the cloud and can interact with each other.




About the project:

RADii is being developed by Thomas Lee since 2020. In 2022 he started a collaboration with Gramazio & Kohler Research at ETHZ for further development of the program in the context of the Immersive Design Studio. 
ETH supported this project with a `Innovedum Grand <https://ethz.ch/de/die-eth-zuerich/lehre/innovedum/innovedum-fund.html>`_ , which among other this made this documentation possible.
