Tutorial: Advanced Presentation
**********************************

.. topic:: What this is about

  This tutorial will show you how to create a more advanced presentation, including animations and advanced settings. You will learn how to create scenarios that can be played in a sequence. 

`Publish Animation`_ allows you to send viewers on predefined paths and `Publish Control`_ lets you control the display settings of all viewers (including weather and background). With `Publish Reference`_ you can direct the viewers to autoload references from the cloud.  

With the scenario manager of the `Save Scenario`_ component, you can bundle different content from publish components and save it into different scenarios, managed by the scenario manager. The saved scenarios can be edited, rearranged and then played in a sequence.

Component list 
-------------------------

to be linked to the `Connect`_ component:

- PublishMaterial_
- PublishGeometry_
- `Publish Section`_ 
- `Publish View`_
- `Publish Animation`_
- `Publish Reference`_
- `Publish Control`_
- `Save Scenario`_
- `Save Content`_


Examples
------------------------

The plan is to do the following: Geometry (a building) that has to be published or downloaded from the server (1), then a walk through it, change the time of the day and the weather (2) and continue your tour via a series of predefined views (3-4).

Setting and sending the above mentioned live during a presentation takes a lot of time. It is quicker to collect the content into scenarios and save them. Switch through them during a presentation then becomes more easier and makes more complex presentations possible.
