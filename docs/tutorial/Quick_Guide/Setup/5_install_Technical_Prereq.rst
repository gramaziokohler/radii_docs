Technicalities and Teaching
*******************************************


**work in progress**

.. @gereon: I think this should become two sections -- Done. maybe have the technical things somewhere else; 
.. i feel that the content of the index, the quick guides and some content from here might need some restructuring.
.. also we should make sure, that the structure here in the explorer matches the chapters names
.. @sarah reply: i agree with the restrucuturing, i will attempt to give this a quick rework
.. regarding the file names an the heading - they did change a lot in the past which is why i did not do the extra work to go through the .conf file
.. and relink them

Technical information
-------------------------

**PC/Mac**

While the Radii Viewer can run on relatively simple machines, the resources necessary scale with the complexity of the model and the level of its optimisation.
As a live renderer the Radii Viewer needs more computing power than the Rhino Plugin. A model that is almost to complex in Rhino, will not run on a device in the Viewer.
For very big models it can be necessary to run the Rhino Editor on a different device than the viewer.
In the cases of very big models it is the best practice to save them to the cloud before a presentation and then commanding a load to the viewers through the `Publish Reference`_ component.

For 32bit system there is a limit of 2GB for each component and saves.

.. topic:: Radii PC requirements:
  
  - ideally min. 4 GB of RAM but also works with 2 GB for small projects
  - a graphics card of medium strength or higher
  - power and ram capacity can vary greatly depending on the size and detail of the 3D model.
  - Rhino 3D license to use Grasshopper (only necessary for the Plugin)


.. topic:: Oculus Quest 2

  - for Pointclouds we found a performance limit of 100 000 Points

  **Best practice:** 
  - in our design studio we found that smaller models such as 1:1 konstruction detail mockups in the path through mode worked best for the hardware. 
 

**Server Storage and channels**

Current storage for:

  - unregistered users:
    - publish limit : 250 mb
    - save limit    : 50 mb
  - registered users: x GB
    - publish limit : 500 mb
    - save limit    : 250 mb 
  - organizations: Can be defined in coordination with Radii, please write to contact@RADii.info

**Infrastructure**

In the scope of the `Imersive Design Studio <https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/d/lehre/448.html>`_ at gramazio Kohler we made good experience with the following Infrastructure.
  
  *Space:*

  - A Vr-Arena: an empty Space of 10 by 10m to walk around and explore
  - Work tables that are situated right next to it for seamless use

  *Tech*

  - Personal laptops of medium strength for each student
  - One strong PC for every second student
    - for more advanced models 

  - A bigg screen/projector relative to the size of the class
    - for group discussion and presentations

  - Oculus or other Vr devices, for every second student
  - personal Phones or Ipads for augmented reality usage
