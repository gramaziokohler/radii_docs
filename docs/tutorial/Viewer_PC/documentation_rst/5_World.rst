1. **Camera**

   - Field of view - controls the field of view 
   - Sensitivity - mouse sensitivity
   - Speed - movement speed

   *Note:* turn slow when someone is following you through the project

2. **Effects** - turning them off increases performance

   - Motion = motion blur
   - Bloom = makes bright spots bleed at the edges, simulating a real camera
   - DOF = depth of field - distance between closest and furthest part of an image that are in focus
   - Chrom = chromatic effect - adds artifacts to the image, simulating a poor len
   - Vignet = darkening on the edges of images, simulating real cameras
   - Inverse = clipping/sectioning leaves a ghost of the hidden geometry

3. **Point Cloud**

   - Point Size
   - Point near size = increases point sizes near you

   *Note:* point clouds are disabled in IOS/Android viewers because they require a lot of computing power

4. **Weather**

   - Quality = resolution of the sky, above lv3 not significantly better
   - Condition = types of weather: rainy, foggy and sunny
   - Fog density = can hide the horizon but also your model

   *Note:* for better performance: turn weather to sunny, fog off, quality to lowest

5. **Time**
6. **Transform**

   - Rotation = rotates all models around the 0 point
   - Scale



7. **Select Viewer**

   .. image:: ../tutorial/Radii_Icons/Viewer.png
      

  - Standard
  - Studio = Studio conditions, no weather or horizon, neutral reflections, color can be set with RGB values

  .. image:: /tutorial/Viewer_PC/images/Menu_Viewer_Studio.png
   :scale: 50 %

  - Pepper Ghost = displays the model in a virtual box
  - Stereo Shutter = for active 3D glasses
    
  - Augmented Reality (AR) = Available on IOs, Android, Oculus. Displays virtual model in a real environment 

8. **Tracking**

      :align: left
      

   .. image:: /tutorial/Viewer_PC/images/World_menu_tracking.png
      :scale: 70 %
      

   - Tracker Method = for using Pepper Ghost viewer mode
     
      - Tracking is done with a camera and the external software: `Optitrack <https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/>`_

   **Note for VR**

  - in the Vr-Viewer the icon opens a different menu that lets you position the X,Y = 0 position and the orientation of it
    
    - this is very helpful to precisely place a model in real space 


9. **Projection**

   .. image:: /tutorial/Radii_Icons/Projection.png
      :align: left
   
   
   .. image:: /tutorial/Viewer_PC/images/World_menu_Projection.png
      :scale: 70 %



   - Projection = screen size settings
     - you can also edit the overall scale and height of the horizon

10. **Grid** = toggles the default floor
11. **Origin** = toggles the origin point
