  This component is used to select geometry that should be published to a channel.

**Input**

.. table::
  :align: left

  =========== ================================ ================
  Name        Description                         Type
  =========== ================================ ================
  Connection  Link with the Connect component     Connection
  Geometry    Geometry you want to upload         Brep or Mesh
  Quality     Mesh Quality for conversion         Settings
  =========== ================================ ================


.. important:: 

 - RADii converts all Rhino surfaces and polysurfaces to meshes. 
 - The automatic mesh conversion often produces many faces which results in big amount of data and longer loading times.
 


.. Tip::

  **Quality:** 
  To control the conversion process to meshes and the smoothness of your geometry you can use the following gh components:

      - Setting (Speed)
      - Setting (Quality)
      - Setting (Custom)

        - use "Min Edge" to sett the minimal edge length this will make your model low poly if you go to high

**Output**

.. table::
  :align: left

  =========   =====================================   ===================
  Name        Description                             Type
  =========   =====================================   ===================
  Log         Documents changes & data send           Text
  Content     Connect to Save component for saving    RADii content
  =========   =====================================   ===================


.. Tip::

  **Log:** helps to identify how much and what kind of data is sent


**Menu:**

.. table::
  :align: left
