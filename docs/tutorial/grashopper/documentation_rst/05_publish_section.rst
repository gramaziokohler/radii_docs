.. tip::

   - Rhino clipping planes are automatically imported and have to be selected in the menu below ``-Activate clipping planes-``
   - If you hav connected one or multiple surfaces with the input: ``Section Plane``, you have to connect a number slider with ``index`` to select them.

  Section Duration:           how quickly the section is moving into place
  Set duration:               toggle to have a moving clipping plane
  Activate clipping planes:   clipping planes from rhino to be selected
  ==========================  ================================================

.. tip:: 
  
  - In Rhino flipping a clipping plane is not recognized by Radii, rotating the plane by 180Â° however achieves the same
  - Names of clipping planes are not carried over into the Grasshopper plugin at the time of writing
