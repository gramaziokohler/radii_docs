  This component is used to publish clipping planes to a channel to visually cut your 3D model. You can either use Rhino clipping planes or use different planes either from Rhino or generated from Grasshopper.


Input
---------

.. table::
  :align: left
    
  ==========  ======================================  ==============
  Name        Description                             Type
  ==========  ======================================  ==============
  Connection  Link with the Connect component         Connection

  Index       Select a plane from a list              Number
  ==========  ======================================  ==============

.. tip::

   - Rhino clipping planes are automatically imported and have to be selected in the menu below ``-Activate clipping planes-``
   - If you have connected one or multiple surfaces with the input: ``Section Plane``, you have to connect a number slider with ``index`` to be able to select them and turn them on or off.

  Section Duration:           how quickly the section is moving into place
  Set duration:               toggle to have a moving clipping plane
  Activate clipping planes:   clipping planes from rhino to be selected
  ==========================  ================================================

.. tip:: 
  
  - If you need to change view direction of a Rhino clipping plane, you have to rotate it 180Â°. The Rhino "flip" command will not work.
  - Names of clipping planes are not carried over into the Grasshopper plugin at the time of writing
