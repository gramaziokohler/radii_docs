Welcome to the guide page, the following resources should give a quick entry into Radii.
Starting with the installation you will find a description on every supported platform 
and then the guides for a range of use cases, sorted by difficulty.

The text files will be updated more frequently than the videos,
 should you come across discrepancies between the videos and what you encounter in Radii.


The setups for each device take between 5 - 15 min each. 

Radii consists of 3 parts:

**Viewer:**
Models can be explored via the Radii Viewers, that have to be installed as stand alone programs.
Viewers are available for a number of different operating systems such as Windows/Mac, IPhone/Android and Oculus VR. 


**Radii Grasshopper Plugin:** 
The plugin enables you to publish(send) and subscribe(receive) 3D models and other geometry. It is running inside of `Rhino 3D <https://www.rhino3d.com/>`_.
